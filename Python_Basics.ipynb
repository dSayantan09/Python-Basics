        "---> Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Its design philosophy emphasizes readability and simplicity, using indentation to define code blocks rather than curly braces or keywords. Python can be used in a wide range of tasks and fields, including web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, scientific computing, scripting etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is popular because:\n",
        "* Simple syntax & ease of learning: Python’s syntax is clean and closely resembles everyday English, making it easy for beginners to read and write code. This makes it a favorite choice as a first programming language.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Versatility and power: It can be used for almost anything—web apps, automation, system scripts, data analysis, machine learning, scientific research, and more, thanks to its general-purpose nature and broad support of programming paradigms (procedural, object-oriented, and functional).\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Rich ecosystem: Python provides access to an enormous number of libraries and frameworks (such as Django and Flask for web development, pandas and NumPy for data science, TensorFlow and scikit-learn for machine learning), greatly accelerating development in both simple scripts and complex industrial applications.\n",
        "\n",
